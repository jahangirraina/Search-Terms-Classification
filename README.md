# Search-Terms-Classification
Construct a classification model that can accurately categorise search terms

# Data Intro
A sample of labelled search term category data is provided in the csv file, trainSet.csv. The file contains two columns: the search term and the search term category. The search term category has been indexed. There are 606,823 examples in the datset with 1,419 different search term categories. There are roughly 427 examples in each category.

# Task
We have to construct a classification model that can accurately categorise search terms in candidateTestSet.txt. Feel free to use whatever model you feel is appropriate for the task.
